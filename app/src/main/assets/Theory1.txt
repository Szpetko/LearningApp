The Palaeolithic period is generally understudied in Greece, because research has traditionally focused on the later parts of prehistory (Neolithic, Bronze Age) and the Classical times. Nevertheless, significant advances have been achieved during the last years and the record has been enriched with new material, collected mostly in the framework of regional surveys but also through systematic or rescue excavations. Not only new caves and rockshelters, but also recently discovered and important open-air sites are now being excavated. The Apidima Cave in Mani, southern Greece, contains the oldest remains of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa, dated to 210,000 years ago. The known anthropological and archaeological finds so far allow the division of the Palaeolithic in the Greek area into Lower (350,000-100,000), Middle (100,000-35,000) and Upper Palaeolithic (35,000-11,000 BP). Human habitation has been traced to caves, rockshelters and open sites. There are, to date, few sites of the Lower Palaeolithic whereas there are more of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This is partly due to the intense tectonic activity in the Greek area and the rise and fall of the Aegean which destroyed every trace of habitation from some geographical regions.

Palaeolithic finds from Greece were first reported in 1867 whereas the first organized research on Palaeolithic sites were conducted between 1927 and 1931 by the Austrian archaeologist Adalbert Markovits. The first excavation of a Palaeolithic site took place in 1942 at Seidi Cave in Boeotia by the German archaeologist Rudolf Stampfuss. More systematic research, however, in Greece was conducted during the 60's in Epirus, Macedonia, Thessaly and the Peloponnese by English, American and German research groups.
